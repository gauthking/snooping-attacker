# Snooping Attacker

## How it works?

- ```npm i``` to install the dependencies
- You can put a test account's private key in the private key variable and also a recipient address. 
- Run the code using ```node index.js``` or ```nodemon index.js```
- Test the code by sending some token funds to our victim's account.


## More Features

- You can fork this repo and work on improving this code and adding more features to it. 
- Maybe you can also come up with a little frontend for this project.
